JavaScript

Programming language - one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
	often incorporating third-party libraries. 
All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, 
	standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).


JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, 
	but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. 
	The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.


Examples of scripted behavior

Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. 
	users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.
Web page animations.
	fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.
Playing browser games.
Controlling the playback of streaming media.
Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.
Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.
Logging data about the user's behavior, then sending it to a server. 
	The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.
Redirecting a user to another page.
Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.


Web libraries and frameworks
	Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for their client-side scripting.

jQuery

jQuery is by far the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of websites.

React

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. 
React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. 
Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.

Angular

Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web application framework.

Vanilla

In contrast, the term "Vanilla JS" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.



Other usage

The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.

Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. 
Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.

JavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.
